# cljs-demo

A Leiningen template for a CLJS demo.

## Usage

This demo app includes a CLJ webserver and two simple CLJS apps:  
- CLJS simple app  
- Reframe SPA  

## Before Clojurepalooza
- clone this repo   `git clone git@github.com:ALai57/cljs-demo-template.git`  
- cd to the newly cloned repo `cd cljs-demo-template`  
- run the command `lein new cljs-demo myproject`  
- glance through the new directory `cljs-demo-template/myproject`  
- If you have a project.clj that's got some missing stuff, you're good to go!


## Still to do  
- Run through example building multiple times
